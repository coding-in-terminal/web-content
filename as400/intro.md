## The Dawn of a New Era in Business Computing

The IBM AS/400, or Application System/400, burst onto the scene in 1988, marking a significant milestone in the world of business computing. This mid-range system was designed to be the Swiss Army knife of computers for small to medium-sized businesses, offering a comprehensive solution that could handle a wide array of tasks. Its introduction brought about a paradigm shift in how businesses approached computing, integrating various functionalities into a single, reliable system.

### Key Features That Set AS/400 Apart

1. **All-in-One Solution:**
   - **Built-in Operating System:** The AS/400 came with its own operating system, OS/400, which was tightly integrated with the hardware, ensuring high performance and stability.
   - **Integrated Database Management System:** A built-in DB2 relational database provided seamless data management capabilities.
   - **Robust Security Features:** Advanced security mechanisms, including object-level security, made it one of the most secure systems of its time.
   - **User-Friendly Interface:** For late 1980s standards, the AS/400's interface was considered easy to use, reducing the learning curve for operators.

2. **Simplified IT Management:**
   - **Single Vendor Solution:** By offering a comprehensive solution from one vendor, IBM reduced the need for businesses to piece together different components from various sources.
   - **Reduced Complexity:** Simplified system administration and maintenance, leading to lower total cost of ownership and less downtime.

## Historical Context and Evolution

### Predecessor Systems

The AS/400 wasn't IBM's first foray into the mid-range business computing market. It was designed as a successor to two earlier systems that had their own legacies:

1. **System/36:** A popular small business computer that offered robust capabilities for its time.
2. **System/38:** Known for its advanced database and object-based system architecture, which influenced the design of the AS/400.

### Backward Compatibility

One of the AS/400's strongest selling points was its ability to run programs written for these older systems. This feature provided immense value to businesses that had already invested heavily in software for the System/36 or System/38, ensuring a smooth transition and protecting their investments.

## Revolutionary Architecture

### Technology Independent Machine Interface (TIMI)

The AS/400 introduced a groundbreaking architectural concept called TIMI. This forward-thinking design:
- **Layer of Abstraction:** Created a layer of abstraction between the software and hardware, allowing applications to be insulated from hardware changes.
- **Hardware Upgrades:** Enabled IBM to upgrade the underlying hardware technology without breaking existing applications.
- **Longevity:** Ensured the long-term viability of software investments, a significant advantage for businesses looking to future-proof their operations.

## Programming Versatility

The AS/400 supported a variety of programming languages, catering to different developer preferences and application needs:

1. **RPG (Report Program Generator):** The primary language of choice for AS/400, known for its strong business application capabilities.
2. **COBOL:** Widely used for business applications, offering a robust environment for commercial computing.
3. **BASIC:** Offered for its simplicity and widespread familiarity among programmers.
4. **C:** Provided for system-level programming and performance-critical applications.

As technology evolved, so did the AS/400's language support:
- **Java:** Added to embrace object-oriented programming and web technologies, keeping the platform relevant in the internet age.
- **Web Development Tools:** Integrated to support the growing importance of internet-based applications, enabling businesses to leverage web technologies.

## Reputation for Reliability

The AS/400 quickly gained a reputation for exceptional reliability and robustness:
- **Uptime:** Many systems ran for years without interruption, demonstrating the platform's stability and reliability.
- **Resilience:** Known for their ability to operate in challenging environments, often found running critical business operations in basements or back offices.
- **Low Maintenance:** Performed their duties quietly without constant attention, reducing the need for extensive IT support.

## Industry Impact

The AS/400 found its way into a wide range of industries:
- **Manufacturing**
- **Finance**
- **Retail**
- **Healthcare**
- **Government Sectors**

It became particularly popular for:
- **Inventory Management Systems**
- **Financial Applications**
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Solutions**
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems**

## Legacy and Continued Relevance

Despite its 1988 origins, the AS/400's influence extends to the present day:
- **Renaming:** Renamed to eServer iSeries in 2000, and later became part of the IBM Power Systems family.
- **Modern IBM i Operating System:** The modern IBM i operating system still powers many businesses, running on contemporary IBM Power Systems hardware.
- **Enduring Nickname:** Many professionals in the field still affectionately refer to these systems as "AS/400".

The longevity and continued relevance of the AS/400 platform stand as a testament to its robust design, forward-thinking architecture, and IBM's commitment to maintaining compatibility while advancing the technology. Its legacy lives on in the many businesses that continue to rely on this dependable and versatile system.
